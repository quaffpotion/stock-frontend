<!-- viewBox takes the width of the svg (which may or may not be automatically
  determined) and makes a scale of e.g. 4 units. Then the height is e.g. 6 units
- except these are using the same scale as the horizontal scale which ultimately
came from the height: to get the behavior we want we add preserveAspectRatio none-->
